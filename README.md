# Project Overview
As a 4-member team, we will design and analyze a MySQL database for the United Nations, extracting valuable insights from global data. The project consists of two major components:  

- **Part A**: Database Design (ER Diagram, Additional Tables)  
- **Part B**: Query Development, Report, and Presentation  

We will utilize **MySQL** for database management and **GitHub** for version control.

# Order of Operations (Based on Project Guidelines)
Following the **Order of Operations for Project.pdf**, our process follows these steps:  

‚úÖ **Step 1**: Work on the ER diagram as a group  
‚úÖ **Step 2**: Finalize 6 tables  
‚úÖ **Step 3**: Gather fictional data for 3 additional tables  
‚úÖ **Step 4**: Create final SQL syntax with all tables and inserted data values  
‚úÖ **Step 5**: Each member sets up the database on their machine  
‚úÖ **Step 6**: Each member tests queries locally  
‚úÖ **Step 7**: Regroup and finalize queries  
‚úÖ **Step 8**: Write the final report  
‚úÖ **Step 9**: Assign 1 member to present the demo on presentation day  
‚úÖ **Step 10**: Ensure at least 20 rows of data per table

# Project Workflow with MySQL & GitHub

## **GitHub Repository Setup**
- A **private GitHub repository** will store SQL scripts, queries, and documentation.  
- Organized file structure for **schema, data, queries, report, and presentation**.  

## **Branching Strategy**
- **main branch**: Stable version of the project.  
- **Feature branches**: Each member works on their assigned feature and submits a pull request.  
- **PR Review Process**: Code must be reviewed before merging.  

## **Database Setup & Version Control**
- ER Diagram and schema stored in **/schema** folder.  
- SQL scripts for **table creation, constraints, and data population** versioned in GitHub.  
- Queries stored in **/queries** with explanations.  

## **Final Submission Process**
- **All final SQL files, report, and presentation slides** pushed to GitHub.  
- **Group leader ensures everything is organized before submission on Canvas.**
